### Duel your fellow Javascript developers in various coding challenges! ###
 - CoDuels is a fun and interactive way to improve your Javascript skills. 
 - You can choose challenges based on difficulty and then either practice by yourself or compete against other online users who will try to pass all the tests before you do.
 - Track your progress on the profile page, view your previous code, and try to get a high score on our leaderboard!

###Technical Information###
 - We used Javascript to build this applicationâ€” Angular, Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, and Firebase. 
 - We created a real-time testing environment in the browser using the Mocha testing framework running in an iframe. 
 - Communication between users is done through Firebase.
