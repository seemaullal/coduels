## Features
 - We created a real-time testing environment for the challenges in the browser using the Mocha testing framework running in an iframe. 
 - Communication and progress were implemented with Firebase.
 - You can choose challenges based on difficulty and then either practice by yourself or compete against other online users who will try to pass all the tests before you do.
